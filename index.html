    <h1>My Favorite Animal</h1>
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Elephants, the largest existing land animals, are mammals of the family Elephantidae. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons.</p>
    <p>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes.</p>

    <h3>Bones</h3>
    <p>The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326â€“351 bones.[62] The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.[63]</p>
    <h3>Head</h3>
    <p>An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction.[64] The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. </p>
